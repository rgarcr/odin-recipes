    <h2>Chicken Ramen</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>medium onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>½ cup rice vinegar, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cooked chicken breasts, shredded</li>
        <li>3 (3 ounce) packages dried ramen noodles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute until starting
            to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and ginger; cook about 30 seconds more. Add rice vinegar, soy sauce,
            oyster sauce, mirin, fish sauce, and sriracha sauce; stir to combine. Add chicken broth and water and bring
            to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer about 5 minutes. Add chicken and bok choy; simmer gently until bok choy is
            just tender, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Add ramen noodles and return to a
            boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes.
            Drain and drizzle with vegetable oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>While ramen is cooking, fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs and bring to a boil. Gently lower
            eggs into the boiling water and cook until yolks are barely set, about 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fill a large bowl with ice water. Transfer soft boiled eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process; let
            sit about 3 minutes. Drain eggs, carefully peel away shells, and slice in half.</li>
        <li>Divide ramen between 4 bowls. Add broth. Top each with jalapeno, green onions, cilantro, and soft boiled
            egg. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
